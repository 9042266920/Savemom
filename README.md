## 📩 Submission

This project is ready to be submitted via GitHub repository link. The recruiter can **clone, install dependencies, and run both frontend and backend easily**.

```

This version uses **proper Markdown headers, code blocks, and bullet points**, so it will render nicely on GitHub.  

If you want, Devi, I can also **add a “Screenshots” section and API usage instructions** to make it **super professional for recruiters**.  

Do you want me to do that?
